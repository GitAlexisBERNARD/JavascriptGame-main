        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h3>Welcome to Samurai Chronicles!</h3>

        <p>Embark on a journey as a skilled samurai with the mission to defeat waves of enemies across challenging
            levels.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>- Level Mode: Survive successive waves of monsters until reaching a specific number.</li>
            <li>- Endless Mode: Hold out against an endless horde of monsters; the game concludes when you run out of
                lives. Aim for
                the highest score by lasting as long as possible!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Special Move</h2>
        <p>As you conquer a certain number of enemies, your samurai charges a special move. Activating it extends the
            attack range,
            enabling you to eliminate multiple enemies in a single powerful strike.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Samurai Chronicles is a side-scrolling action/strategy game, limiting your character's movement along the
            X-axis
            (left
            or right).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Enemies approach from both directions.</li>
            <li>- To attack, press the corresponding directional arrow when an enemy is within range.</li>
            <li>- The samurai executes a teleporting close combat strike. Beware of a brief vulnerability during
                directional
                changes.</li>
        </ul>
